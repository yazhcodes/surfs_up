# OVERVIEW

This project is about analyzing Oahu's annual temperature and precipitation data, sourced from nine weather stations, to determine whether it has ideal weather conditions to support a Surf and Icecream Shop business. This Challenge in particular is a deep dive into the June and December statistics, to test Oahu's year round sustainability.

# RESULTS

* There are **1700 recordings** available for June month which is _11% more_ than Decemeber's data. So we begin the analysis with an understanding that it IS possible June's stats could be a bit more accurate than December's.
* The **average temperature** of June and December is recorded as _74.9° and 71.04°_ respectively. December being colder than June does not come as a surprise. And it also reassures us that our analysis is infact going on the right track.
* The **standard deviation** of December is _3.74_ which is slightly higher than June's standard deviation of _3.25_. It's no biggie though!
* The **minimum recorded temperatures** of June and December are far apart at _64° and 56°_, however the **maximum recorded temperatures** turned out much closer than we anticipated at _85° and 83°_ respectively.
